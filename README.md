# Mandy - Time Capsule Letter Service Based on `Sui` + `Seal` + `Walrus`

[中文文档](./README_CN.md)

Mandy is a `dApp` built on the Sui blockchain that allows users to create and send "time capsule" letters, which can only be viewed by recipients after a specific point in time. Both the letter content and attachments are encrypted and decrypted using `Seal`, and letter attachments are stored in `Walrus`.

## Project Features

- 🕰️ **Customizable Timing**: Set specific time points after which letters can be viewed
- 💌 **Emotional Delivery**: Create meaningful messages to be delivered to important people at specific moments in the future
- 💙 **Psychological Comfort**: Provides users with a new way of emotional expression
- 🔐 **Privacy and Security**: Based on `Sui` + `Seal`, ensuring privacy protection and immutability of letter content
- 🌐 **Decentralized Storage**: Using `Walrus` decentralized technology to store letter attachments
